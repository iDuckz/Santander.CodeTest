# Santander.CodeTest
## Description
This project is a RESTful API developed using .NET Core 8. It retrieves the best stories from the Hacker News API and sorts them in descending order by score.

## How to execute the API
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iDuckz/Santander.CodeTest.git
   cd Santander.CodeTest

2. Open the solution using Visual Studio and run it locally
3. Get localhost URL generated by Visual Studio (example: http://localhost:5053/) and add the following api/story/getstories/?n=10
4. The generated URL should be like this http://localhost:5053/api/story/getstories/?n=10 where n is equal to the number of stories to retrieve
5. Paste this URL into a browser or programs like Postman and generate a GET request

## Next enhancements or changes
1. Implement and authorization method like JWT to protect access to the API.
2. Add pagination to handle large lists of stories.
3. Write unit tests to improve code coverage.
4. Separate the bussiness rules in different layer
